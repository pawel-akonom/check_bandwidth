check_bandwidth
---------------

Nagios plugin for monitoring bandwidth usage on netwrk interface in Linux operatig system

Script was found on Nagios plugins dictonary:
http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Network-Connections%2C-Stats-and-Bandwidth/Check-interface-bandwidth/details

I removed Cisco support, I made some code refactoring and I added arguments parsing and checking

Script is reading informations from sysfs about sent and received bytes: 
/sys/class/net/<interface_name>/statistics/rx_bytes
/sys/class/net/<interface_name>/statistics/tx_bytes
for period of seconds defined by script argument.
